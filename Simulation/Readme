We conducted simulation studies to test the performance of three different models as shown in Chapter 4. The files "base_model_Ordinal.txt", "base_model_binomial.txt" and "base_model_ZIP.txt" were used to generate simulated data and to fit the initial models which act as the true parameters for each of the simulations. 
Since each simulation takes a long time to run, the files "Simulation_ordinal_logit.txt", "Simulation_binary_logit.txt" and "Simulation_ZIP.txt" split the simulations into 50 R scripts which each contain 10 simulations. 
The R file "1.R" is one example of the 50 R scripts generated by "Simulation_ZIP.txt". Finally, the 50 R scripts for each model were run on a cluster network (Grex) and the results were combined using the files "combining_simulation_results_ordinal_logit.txt", "combining_simulation_results_binary_logit.txt" and "combining_simulation_results_ZIP.txt".
